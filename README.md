## Concept Overview

**"Immersed in Time"** is a digital artwork created for the SuperteamUK Hackathon. It depicts a surreal scene of individuals working on laptops while immersed in the flowing waters of the Thames, with Big Ben standing prominently in the background. The work encapsulates the paradox of modern co-working life, where we are deeply engaged in our tasks, seemingly in our own ‘bubbles,’ as time steadily flows by.

## Artistic Interpretation

The water surrounding the workers symbolizes the relentless, unstoppable passage of time, while the Big Ben clock tower serves as a landmark reminder in the heart of London. This setting creates a thought-provoking blend of stillness and movement, drawing attention to the reality that, within the immersive world of work, life continues around us, flowing like the Thames.
